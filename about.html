					<p>Sustain Your Sh*t was born to help you make sustainable changes in your lifestyle. It can be hard to know where to start, and the majority of sustainability resources will probably make you panic that it'll either cost you way to much or be impossible to keep up with long-term. That's where we've got your back. Being sustainable is about being able to literally sustain your choices. Just like a diet, it will be easy for you to quickly relapse if the choices you've made cannot be maintaned. All we ask is that you take as big a step as you can and stick with it.</p>
					<p>Every week we'll feature a different piece of your life where you can make a difference with three options. This isn't to say that the three options are the only ones (far from it), but we know it can be hard to take the first step and find advice on where to start. That's where we come in. Check back every week for something new—updates come every Monday!</p>
