				<h3>About Sustain Your Sh*t</h3>
				<p>Have you been enjoying a beautiful weekend only to scroll through social media and stumble upon some video a friend shared of a whale washed up on shore dead because of the bundle of plastic that has clogged up its stomach and forced it to starve which then causes you to ponder all the trash you've produced over your lifetime plus the plastic you've been *thinking* you've recycled only to see a green Starbucks straw like you just used yesterday sticking out of the bundle of plastic that's been extracted from this dead whale? Take a deep breath in...and now let it out.</p>
				<p>Yes, as humans we are causing this horrible shit to happen.</p>
				<p>Yes, you can make a difference.</p>
				<p>No, it isn't that difficult.</p>
				<p>Sustain Your Sh*t was born to help you make sustainable changes in your lifestyle. It can be hard to know where to start, and the majority of sustainability resources will probably make you freeze up in panic with fear that it'll either 1. Cost you way to much or 2. Be impossible to keep up with long-term. That's where we've got your back. Being sustainable is about being able to literally sustain your choices. Just like a diet, it will be easy for you to quickly relapse if the choices you've made cannot be maintaned. All we ask is that you take as big a step as you can and stick with it.</p>
				<p>Every week we'll feature a different piece of your life where you can make a difference with three options. This isn't to say that the three options are the only ones—far from it, but we know it can be hard to take the first step and find advice on where to start.</p>
				<p>That's where we come in. Check back every week for something new—updates come every Monday!</p>
